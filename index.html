<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>I’ve been playing on and off again with the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell programming language</a> for more than six years now, but I never ever sat down to try to build real software with it. I’ve played around, read a lot about it, read a lot about the theoretical concepts around it and even used it a bit in production with very simple, localized, script-like small chunks of code that did very specialized things.</p>
<p>After all this time I think I have enough time and will to actually try to do something more complex in Haskell. The problem is: I’ve spent most of my time around haskell learning theoretical concepts, syntax and curiosities. I didn’t spent any time learning design patterns and software engineering in Haskell. And I really think learning about those things isn’t possible until you start to write an actual application.</p>
<h3 id="clean-architecture">Clean Architecture</h3>
<p>When developing applications in typical object-oriented fashion, I typically resort to the so called <a href="https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">clean architecture</a> idea:</p>

<p>This principle consists mainly in making sure dependencies always flow from code inwards in the figure above. At the very core your main domain entities - typically, in Java or similar languages, the classes that define the domain where your applications works and the basic logic of those objects. Things like: <code>User</code>, <code>CheckingAccount</code>, …</p>
<p>In the next layer are Use Cases - classes that define the logic of your application. If your application have users and they can create accounts, you would have a use case <code>CreateNewUserAccount</code>, describing the logic of how a user create a new account. The important part is that this code will <strong>only depend on the domain entities</strong>.</p>
